Github and git
vcs =version control system = 2 major problem 1) sharing of code 2)versioning

vertion contorl 
cvs,svn= centralized
git=disributed ,fork

git = open source ,downlod from ec2 instance 
github=usability, isses ,commenting,reviewing ,project tracking 

types ,bitbuket, gitlab
open source tool - it means it is free 
source code versining system 

source code -set of lines or programing language 

local repository  - in our michen =======git
Remote repository -centralalized SCM - distributed vertion system ===github==== owned my microsoft git hub is cloudhosting platform 
# List global configuration for the current user in windows 
git config --global --list
# Set the name and email to the git global configuration
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
# To Verify the previous commands
git config --global --list
git --version

=======git======
to install git search in crome download git for windows ,linux ,mac 
in linux = ubantu =apt-get install git, fedora = yum install git,

we can do in two way to prcatice in aws vm= install git = and type git it showes the all commands git supports
download in windows and open one emty folder and open with git bash and type git it will show the all commands which supports
======commands===== 
git init   =intialize emty repository 
ls -la     =hiden file to check the emty git created r not 
.
..
.git       =it is hiden file it trakes by this .git  to all repositories 
ls .git    =to see what and all present inside .git 
HEAD  config  description  hooks/  info/  objects/  refs/

everthing it track as =objects 
hooks= prevent unintetinally creating api tooken
config = confic cetificates ,etc

git status 
gives status of intraked files 

git add . =trakes all the files 
git add (repo name) =trakes perticular file 
git diff   === gives difference b/w file changes =if file alredy tracked and others made changes and and not tracked files than showes difference

git commit -m "this is my 1st v1"  == it commites which are files present in .git folder if we not added files to .git folder tha it showes modified filename 
git status 
git add (file name)
git commit -m "v2"
git log  ========= showes both the commits id  what changes had done 
copy commit id to go to that vertion ====  git reset --hard 4fc27bccc89e081fc085cc63e02f34d012376aa4 (commit id)
and cat file  ====== cat git showes that vertion data present
# Check the changes made in each commit
git log -p
#The following prints the commit message alone with commit ID
$ git log --oneline
4fc27bc (HEAD -> master) this is my 1st v1


=================Branching startergie==============
branch is separation 
master branch ===== up to date it should be 
feture branch ====for new feture we create feture branch and work in it insted off working in master branch 
relese branch ===== build and dilviery to relse 
hot/bug fix branches ===== 














========to share the code or distributed system  github, self hosted git ,bitbuket
create a github account from google type githublogin======github======
create respositoty and can add files from git hub only are we can push from git to github to copy use fork
git push ===== to push changes from git to github
in code use url and in git ===== git clone "url" =======it will take all repositeries
https ====use password   ssh ======public key 

git remotr -v ===== need to check configerd git hub r not
# Show available remote upstreams along with their URLs
git remote -v
git remote add "location"
# Adds a remote named origin for the repository at the specified url   
git remote add origin  https://github.com/mycloudazure/gitpractice
